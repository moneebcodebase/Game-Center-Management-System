## 🧱 Architecture & Technical Concepts

**Multi-layered architecture:**
Presentation Layer → Business Layer → Data Access Layer , Infrastructure Layer
```

├── GCMS/                        # Presentation Layer (WinForms UI)
├── GCMS_Business/               # Business Logic Layer
├── GCMS_DataAccess/             # Data Access Layer 
├── GCMS_Infrastructure/         # Support  Other Layers
├── Database/                    # Contains The Database Script
├── README.md                    # Project documentation
```



**Core Technologies & Frameworks:**
- C# (.NET Framework 4.8)  
- Windows Forms (WinForms)  
- SQL Server / T-SQL (variables, CTEs, procedures, transactions)  
- ADO.NET for database communication  
- App.config for database connection  
- Cryptography for secure credentials  
- Event Log for application errors  
- Asynchronous programming, delegates, and events  
- User Controls for reusable UI components

## 🗄️ Database Setup
   (you can view the database diagram after setting up the database)
1. Open **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**  
2. Run the script:  
3. Creates all tables, relationships, constraints, and default admin user:
   Username: admin
   Password: admin123

## ⚙️ Configuration

Edit your `App.config` connection string:

```xml
<connectionStrings>
    <add name="GCMS_ConnectionString" 
         connectionString="Data Source=.;Initial Catalog=GCMS;User ID=YOUR_USER;Password=YOUR_PASSWORD;" 
         providerName="System.Data.SqlClient" />
</connectionStrings>
```

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Open in Visual Studio
3.Restore NuGet packages (automatic on build)
4.Update connection string in App.config
5.Build and run the application
